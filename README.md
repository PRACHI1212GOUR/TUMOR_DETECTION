# TUMOR_DETECTION
 Brain tumors are currently the second leading cause of cancer, posing a significant risk to a large number of patients. Detecting brain tumors accurately and efficiently is crucial for effective treatment and ensuring patient safety. To achieve this, the medical field requires rapid, automated, efficient, and reliable techniques for tumor detection, particularly concerning brain tumors. Accurate detection plays a vital role in the trearment process, as it helps doctors protect patients from potential dangers associated with tumors. Various image processing techniques are employed in this application to aid doctors in providing proper treatment and saving a considerable number of tumor patients.

 #RESULTS:
 We achieved considerable accuracy with Convo;utional Neural Network model after the training process was 94.60% 

 #CONCLUSION:
 The primary objective of this research is to develop an efficient automatic brain tumor classificationa system with high accuracy, perfomance, and low complexity. The study focused on building a CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to automatically detect brain tumors in MRI brain scans. The data used in the study consisted of brain MRI images for tumor identification.
